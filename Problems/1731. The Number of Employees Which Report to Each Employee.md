```sql
Create table If Not Exists Employees(employee_id int, name varchar(20), reports_to int, age int)
Truncate table Employees
insert into Employees (employee_id, name, reports_to, age) values ('9', 'Hercy', 'None', '43')
insert into Employees (employee_id, name, reports_to, age) values ('6', 'Alice', '9', '41')
insert into Employees (employee_id, name, reports_to, age) values ('4', 'Bob', '9', '36')
insert into Employees (employee_id, name, reports_to, age) values ('2', 'Winston', 'None', '37')
```

Table: `Employees`

```
+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| employee_id | int      |
| name        | varchar  |
| reports_to  | int      |
| age         | int      |
+-------------+----------+
employee_id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the employees and the id of the manager they report to. Some employees do not report to anyone (reports_to is null). 
```

For this problem, we will consider a **manager** an employee who has at least 1 other employee reporting to them.

Write an SQL query to report the ids and the names of all **managers**, the number of employees who report **directly** to them, and the average age of the reports rounded to the nearest integer.

Return the result table ordered by `employee_id`.

The query result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: 
Employees table:
+-------------+---------+------------+-----+
| employee_id | name    | reports_to | age |
+-------------+---------+------------+-----+
| 9           | Hercy   | null       | 43  |
| 6           | Alice   | 9          | 41  |
| 4           | Bob     | 9          | 36  |
| 2           | Winston | null       | 37  |
+-------------+---------+------------+-----+
Output: 
+-------------+-------+---------------+-------------+
| employee_id | name  | reports_count | average_age |
+-------------+-------+---------------+-------------+
| 9           | Hercy | 2             | 39          |
+-------------+-------+---------------+-------------+
Explanation: Hercy has 2 people report directly to him, Alice and Bob. Their average age is (41+36)/2 = 38.5, which is 39 after rounding it to the nearest integer.
```

**Solution:**

```sql
SELECT
    one.employee_id,
    one.name,
    COUNT(other.reports_to) AS reports_count,
    ROUND(AVG(other.age * 1.0), 0) AS average_age
FROM Employees one INNER JOIN EMployees other
    ON one.employee_id = other.reports_to
WHERE other.reports_to IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY one.employee_id, one.name
ORDER BY one.employee_id;
```
